# Language Identification based on Voxforge Speech Corpus
We address the problem of identifying languages based on Voxforge speech corpus. We used corpora for three languages: English, German and Persian, from Voxforge. In addition, we built two additional corpora, the first one for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the other one for Kabyl, one of the Algerian Berber dialects. To tackle this task, we used three classifiers, namely: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extra Trees Classifier. We obtained an average precision of 87.45% for binary classification compared to 44% for the multi-class one.

# The corpus
The corpus is made of 635 utterances sampled at 16 kHz and coded on 16 bits. The number of speakers involved in the recording of this data is 220. 65% of this dataset had been used for training, and the remaining for the test phase.
