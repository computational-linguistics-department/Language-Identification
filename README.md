# Language-Identification
We address the problem of identifying languages based on Voxforge speech corpus. We used corpora for three languages: English, German and Persian, from Voxforge. In addition, we built two additional corpora, the first one for Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and the other one for Kabyl, one of the Algerian Berber dialects. To tackle this task, we used three classifiers, namely: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Extra Trees Classifier. We obtained an average precision of 87.45% for binary classification compared to 44% for the multi-class one.
